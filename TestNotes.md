# Testing Notes

## Advanced Space Planning

* 0ba77727-c282-4f4c-9938-71e50d884002 turn 201-204
  We could survive if we didn't cut the space in half at move 204. Need
  to find possible escape routes from a space (as the tail moves along X
  amount of turns in the future).

* 510f71b1-d22a-49e5-a65c-81ee04751204 turn 140-145
  By the time we go into the corner/edge space, it is 1 square too small. But
  because of the equal H2H, the other space appears even smaller by 145. What
  we should do is use the time starting at 140 to carve out a bigger space in
  the corner by moving into the neutral territory.
